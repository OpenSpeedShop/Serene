INTRODUCTION
------------
I created this library because the available libraries for 3D graphing are all out of date (qwtplot3d was last updated in 2007),
didn't include standard functionality like tooltips over data points, or were like shooting a mouse with a canon (gnuplot is
easier in most cases).  For the Open|SpeedShop GUI project we needed a simple graphing library that allowed for creation of
the standard 2D graphs (bar, column, line, pie) along with 3D graphing support.  In order to make it's appearance seamless
across all charts, a single library that allowed the 3D graphs to be locked to face forward was the most expedient solution.
